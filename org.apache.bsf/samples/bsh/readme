To run any of the scripts here, type:

	java org.apache.bsf.Main -in filename -mode exec

where filename is any of the script files here.

You need to have the BSF jar file and any language-specific
jars/zips on your classpath.

Note: The mode must be set to "exec" to avoid the language's
      interpreter/compiler from treating the script as an
      expression.
