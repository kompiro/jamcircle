In this demo we create some components in Java, register them into BSF,
then run a script using BSF to affect those components, and finally
come back into Java and continue on.

To run, type:

	java ScriptedUI scriptfilename

where filename is any of the script files here. 

You need to have the BSF jar file and any language-specific
jars/zips on your classpath.
