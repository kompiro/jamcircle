To run this demo type:

	java TestCalc filename

Please note that as of 2006-09-07 the proprietary Windows scripting languages
do not run with the standard distribution. Reason: due to licensing issues IBM
was not able to donate the necessary supporting OLE/ActiveX C++ code.

Maybe someone picks up this task?

The Rexx example (transcribed from the original Windows script examples) works,
as it is not dependent on the Windows infrastructure:

        java TestCalc TestCalc.rex

To run this demo type:
	java TestCalc filename
where filename is one of TestCalc.vbs or TestCalc.jss or TestCalc.pls.

You need to have bsf.jar on your classpath and ../../lib/win32 on your path.
