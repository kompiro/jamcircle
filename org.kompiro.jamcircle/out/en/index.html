<h2>What is JAM Circle</h2>

<p>JAM Circle is a Kanban Application Platform using Card(like Sticky note) and Lane(Pane) or Icon.</p>

<p>JAM Circle is supported to connect XMPP service(like GTalk) and send card data to other user.
Sometimes you use mail to ask to do your Task to someone.You can use JAM Circle to these situations.</p>

<p>JAM Circle is defined Action using scripting language,JRuby or JavaScript(using Rhino).
You can define action when you open board,and put card to lane(icon),remove card from lane(icon).
For example ,if you want to plan some tasks in BTS(like Bugzilla,or Trac,or Redmine... these has API to public services.)
you define script to get some tickets from BTS on board script,
and you define script to change the priority ,due on lane script.</p>

<h2>Why did I name this application "JAM Circle"?</h2>

<p>Please imagine.You do your work in your office.
If you do that only you?Does someone help you to do that?
I think, it is sometimes no,but it is often YES!
Most tasks you can't do that only you!
So I imagine, how to help you to ask "Please do the task".
Sometimes I ask my co-workers to do my task using E-Mail.
But the mail can't help me when it is done,hum?
If it isn't done,sometimes I can't be done my work,It is terrible for me!
So I started to develop this application(using Kanban).
I think,sending Kanban card is seen like JAM session.
JAM session is a metapha from music.A music player plays his music,and someone heres the music,
then she starts her music for his music to be more funny,more interesting,more powerful,more beautiful,and so on!
We can do like that in work context using Kanban!
So I started to develop this application,and I called it "JAM Circle".</p>
