      <p>
      This 2.0.1 release contains fixes for bugs found in the 2.0.0 release.
      </p>
      <h3>Potentially breaking changes and fixes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Fixed a bug in how code generators collect method arguments from generated source, which impacted the Messages interfaces generated for UiBinder template files.
        In GWT 2.0, such argument names were incorrectly changed to ARGn. Most GWT applications will be unaffected, but external systems relying on these names will need to be updated.
        </li>
        <li>The development mode server will, by default, only bind to localhost which will break cross-machine debugging.  You can get the old behavior by specifying 
        <code>-bindAddress 0.0.0.0</code>.  Please see issue (#<a
        href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4322">4322</a>)
        for more details.  For webAppCreator-generated ant files, you can pass
        this with <tt>ant -Dgwt.args="-bindAddress 0.0.0.0" devmode</tt>.</li>
        <li>The CurrencyList/CurrencyData APIs are now public - if you were relying upon these classes in their non-public location, you should only need to update your 
        imports.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Noteworthy Fixed Issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>UiBinder Image class with resource attribute, removes styles on that image (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4415">#4415</a>)</li>
      	<li>Widgets lose focus if its placed on FocusPanel (Opera, Safari) (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1471">#1471</a>)</li>
      	<li>Remove method in SplitLayoutPanel is broken (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4217">#4217</a>)</li>
        <li>Splitter constructor hard codes the background color of the splitter to white (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4335">#4335</a>)</li>
        <li>Image should provide method to set alternative text (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4335">#4335</a>)</li>
        <li>CssResource cannot parse unescaped '-', '_' in class selectors and unknown at-rules (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=3946">#3946</a>)</li>
        <li>Focusable implementation breaks ScrollPanels in Safari (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1313">#1313</a>)</li>
        <li>RequestBuilder restricted to GET and POST (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=3388">#3388</a>)</li>
        <li>HTMLTable.Cell.getElement() calls getCellFormatter().getElement() with row and column swapped RequestBuilder restricted to GET and POST (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=3757">#3757</a>)</li>
        <li>MenuBar steals focus when hovered (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=3884">#3884</a>)</li>
        <li>TabLayoutPanel tabs don't line up properly on IE (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4447">#4447</a>)</li>
        <li>webAppCreator produces ant build files which support the gwt.args
        property for passing additional flags to the gwtc and devmode rules,
        such as <tt>ant -Dgwt.args="-style PRETTY" gwtc</tt>.</li>

      <h2>Release Notes for 2.0.0-rc2</h2>
      <h3>New Features</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          GWT 2.0 introduces a number of new panels, which together form a stable basis for fast and predictable
          application-level layout. The official doc is still in progress, but for an overview please see
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/LayoutDesign">Layout Design</a> on the wiki.
          The new set of panels includes
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/RootLayoutPanel.html">RootLayoutPanel</a>,
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/LayoutPanel.html">LayoutPanel</a>,
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/DockLayoutPanel.html">DockLayoutPanel</a>,
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/SplitLayoutPanel.html">SplitLayoutPanel</a>,
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/StackLayoutPanel.html">StackLayoutPanel</a>, and
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/TabLayoutPanel.html">TabLayoutPanel</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            UiBinder now directly supports <code>LayoutPanel</code>. For example:<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">
&lt;g:LayoutPanel&gt;
  &lt;g:layer left='1em' width='20px'&gt;&lt;g:Label&gt;left-width&lt;/g:Label&gt;&lt;/g:Layer&gt;
  &lt;g:layer right='1em' width='20px'&gt;&lt;g:Label&gt;right-width&lt;/g:Label&gt;&lt;/g:Layer&gt;
  &lt;g:layer&gt;&lt;g:Label&gt;nada&lt;/g:Label&gt;&lt;/g:Layer&gt;
&lt;/g:LayoutPanel&gt;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/Window.Navigator.html">Window.Navigator</a>
          now provides access to the native browser's navigator object.
        </li>
      </ul> 

      <h3>Breaking changes and known issues/bugs/problems</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Windows users who have previously installed the <i>Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin for IE</i> will have
          to uninstall the old version. Use the following steps:
          <ol>
            <li>From the Windows "Start" Menu, open "Control Panel"</li>
            <li>Select "Add/Remove Programs"</li>
            <li>Select "Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin for IE" then click "Uninstall"</li>
            <li>
              Run Internet Explorer and browse to
              <a href="http://gwt.google.com/samples/MissingPlugin">http://gwt.google.com/samples/MissingPlugin</a>
              to install the new  version of the plugin
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Running a <code>GWTTestCase</code> as compiled script was previously done using <code>-Dgwt.args="-web"</code>.
          The <code>-web</code> argument is now deprecated in favor of <code>-prod</code>, consistent with the
          terminology change from <i>web mode</i> to <i>production mode</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>-portHosted</code> command line argument for <code>DevMode</code> and <code>GWTTestCase</code>
          has changed to <code>-codeServerPort</code> to be consistent with the new term <i>code server</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>junitCreator</code> command line utility has been removed.  Instead, the <code>webAppCreator</code>
          utility takes new argument: <code>-junit <i>&lt;path-to-junit-jar&gt;</i></code>, which incorporates the
          functionality previously in junitCreator and generates <code>ant test</code> targets.
        </li>
        <li>
          When running development mode on on Chrome, any JavaScript objects that pass into Java code will
          be assigned a new property <code>__gwt_ObjectId</code>.  This could break native code that looks
          iterates through the properties of such an object.  To work around this issue, see this
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/diff?old=4807&r=7063&format=side&path=/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/json/client/JSONObject.java">example</a>
          of our changes to <code>JSONObject</code> (scroll to the bottom). 
        </li>
        <li>
          Compile reports (formerly SOYC reports) are now generated with the <code>-compileReport</code> command
          line flag to <code>Compiler</code>.  The generated reports are now written to the private <i>extra</i>
          directory. If no <code>-extra</code> argument is specified, this directory defaults to <code>extras/</code>.
          This eliminates an unlikely security risk of accidentally deploying compile reports to a publicly accessible location. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fixed Issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In UiBinder <code>&lt;ui:style&gt;</code> blocks, css class names may contain dashes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-Java method safe characters in inline <ui:style> class names doesn't work
          (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4052">#4052</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          @external does not work reliably for inline styles in <ui:style>
          (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4053">#4053</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Various false alarm warnings about invalid JSNI references have been fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Various Swing UI improvements.
        </li>
        <li>
          RPC calls leaking memory for IE
          (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4133">#4133</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          deRPC raise an Error 500 instead of propagating the correct RuntimeException in ProdMode
          (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4237">#4237</a>)
        </li>

      <h2>Release Notes for 2.0.0-rc1</h2>
      <p>
        This release contains big changes to improve developer productivity, make cross-browser development easier, and produce faster web applications. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Things that are changing with GWT 2.0 that might otherwise be confusing without explanation</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Terminology changes: We're going to start using the term "development mode" rather than the old term "hosted mode." 
          The term "hosted mode" was sometimes confusing to people, so we'll be using the more descriptive term "development mode" from now on. 
          For similar reasons, we'll be using the term "production mode" rather than "web mode" when referring to compiled script.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes to the distribution: Note that there's only one download, and it's no longer platform-specific. 
          You download the same zip file for every development platform. 
          This is made possible by the new plugin approach used to implement development mode (see below). 
          The distribution file does not include the browser plugins themselves; those are downloaded separately the first time you use development mode in a browser that doesn't have the plugin installed. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Major New Features</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          In-Browser Development Mode: Prior to 2.0, GWT hosted mode provided a special-purpose "hosted browser" to debug your GWT code. 
          In 2.0, the web page being debugged is viewed within a regular-old browser. 
          Development mode is supported through the use of a native-code plugin called the <i>Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin</i> for many popular browsers. 
          In other words, you can use development mode directly from Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Code Splitting: Developer-guided code splitting with <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.html#runAsync(com.google.gwt.core.client.RunAsyncCallback)">GWT.runAsync()</a> allows you to chunk your GWT code into multiple fragments for faster startup. 
          Imagine having to download a whole movie before being able to watch it. 
          Well, that's what you have to do with most Ajax apps these days -- download the whole thing before using it. 
          With code splitting, you can arrange to load just the minimum script needed to get the application running and the user interacting, while the rest of the app is downloaded as needed. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Declarative User Interface: GWT's <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/uibinder/client/UiBinder.html">UiBinder</a> now allows you to create  user interfaces mostly declaratively. 
          Previously, widgets had to be created and assembled programmatically, requiring lots of code. 
          Now, you can use XML to declare your UI, making the code more readable, easier to maintain, and faster to develop. 
          The Mail sample has been updated to show a practical example of using UiBinder.
        </li> 
        <li>
          Bundling of resources via <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/resources/client/ClientBundle.html">ClientBundle</a>.
          GWT introduced <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/ImageBundle.html">ImageBundle</a> in 1.4 to provide automatic spriting of images. 
          ClientBundle generalizes this technique, bringing the power of combining and optimizing resources into one download to things like text files, CSS, and XML. 
          This means fewer network round trips, which in turn can decrease application latency -- especially on mobile applications. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Using HtmlUnit for running test cases based on <a href="http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.0/com/google/gwt/junit/client/GWTTestCase.html">GWTTestCase</a>: 
          Prior to 2.0, <code>GWTTestCase</code> relied on SWT and native code versions of actual browsers to run unit tests.
          As a result, running unit tests required starting an actual browser.          
          As of 2.0, <code>GWTTestCase</code> no longer uses SWT or native code. 
          Instead, it uses <i>HtmlUnit</i> as the built-in browser. 
          Because HtmlUnit is written entirely in the Java language, there is no longer any native code involved in typical test-driven development.
          Debugging GWT Tests in development mode can be done entirely in a Java debugger.
        </li>
      </ul> 
    
      <h3>Breaking changes and known issues/bugs/problems</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prior to 2.0, GWT tools such as the compiler were provide in a platform-specific jar (that is, with names like <code>gwt-dev-windows.jar</code>).
          As of 2.0, GWT tools are no longer platform specific and they reside in generically-named <code>gwt-dev.jar</code>.
          You are quite likely to have to update build scripts to remove the platform-specific suffix, but that's the extent of it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The development mode entry point has changed a few times since GWT 1.0.
          It was originally called <code>GWTShell</code>, and in GWT 1.6 a replacement entry point called <code>HostedMode</code> was introduced.
          As of GWT 2.0, to reflect the new "development mode" terminology, the new entry point for development mode is <code>com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode</code>.
          Sorry to keep changing that on ya, but the good news is that the prior entry point still works. 
          But, to really stay current, we recommend you switch to the new <code>DevMode</code> entry point.

        <li>
          Also due to the "development mode" terminology change, the name of the ant build target produced by <code>webAppCreator</code> has changed from <code>hosted</code> to <code>devmode</code>.
          In other words, to start development mode from the command-line, type <code>ant devmode</code>.

        <li>
          HtmlUnit does not attempt to emulate authentic browser layout. 
          Consequently, tests that are sensitive to browser layout are very likely to fail.
          However, since <code>GWTTestCase</code> supports other methods of running tests, such as Selenium, that do support accurate layout testing, it can still make sense to keep layout-sensitive tests in the same test case as non-layout-sensitive tests.  
          If you want such tests to be ignored by HtmlUnit, simply annotate the test methods with <code>@DoNotRunWith({Platform.Htmlunit})</code>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Versions of Google Plugin for Eclipse prior to 1.2 will only allow you to add GWT release directories that include a file with a name like <code>gwt-dev-windows.jar</code>. 
          You can fool it by sym linking or copying gwt-dev.jar to the appropriate name. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The way arguments are passed to the GWT testing infrastructure has been revamped. 
          There is now a consistent syntax to support arbitrary "run styles", including user-written, with no changes to GWT itself.
          For example, <code>-selenium FF3</code> has become <code>-runStyle selenium:FF3</code>. 
          This change likely does not affect typical test invocation scripts, but if you do use <code>-Dgwt.args</code> to pass arguments to <code>GWTTestCase</code>, be aware that you may need to make some changes.

      <h2>Release Notes for 1.7.1</h2>
      <p>
        This release adds support for Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) by allowing hosted mode to run with a 1.6 JRE in 32-bit
        mode (using the -d32 flag).

      <h2>Release Notes for 1.7.0</h2>
      <p>
        This release adds explicit support for Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 3.5, and Safari 4 as well as a few high-priority bug fixes.
        In all other respects, it is very similar to GWT 1.6.
        Note, however, that this release is version 1.7.0 rather than version 1.6.5 to signify a potentially breaking change for libraries 
        that use deferred binding to specialize code based on user agent (see the next section for technical details).
      </p>
      <h3>Potentially breaking changes and fixes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This release includes explicit support for IE8, which has some significant behavioral changes from prior versions of IE.
          These changes are great enough that the new value <code>ie8</code> has been added for the <code>user.agent</code> deferred binding client property.
          If you have deferred binding rules (i.e. <code>&lt;replace-with&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;generate-with&gt;</code>) or property providers 
          that are sensitive to <code>user.agent</code>, you may need to update them to account for the <code>ie8</code> value. 
          For more information, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/IE8Support">technical notes</a>.

      <h2>Release Notes for 1.5.2</h2>
      <h3>Potentially breaking changes and fixes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>History.onHistoryChanged()</code> has been added back (it was missing from 1.5 RC2) but is now deprecated.  Application startup should be handled by calling the new <code>History.fireCurrentHistoryState()</code>.</li>
        <li>Fields marked <code>final</code> in serializable types will now generate a warning; the fact that they were not being serialized was a source of confusion.  Mark such fields both <code>final</code> and <code>transient</code> to avoid the warning.</li>
        <li>Instance methods on overlay types cannot be accessed from JSNI.  (This used to work in hosted mode, but failed at runtime in web mode.)</li>
        <li>The hosted mode server no longer serves <code>hosted.html</code> from a module's public path; instead the file is read directly from the classpath.  This file is tightly coupled with the hosted mode implementation and was not meant to be user overridable.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>General Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Collections.unmodifiableSortedSet()</code> and <code>Collections.unmodifiableSortedMap()</code> are now implemented.</li>
        <li>The new <code>Accessibility</code> class enables widget authors to add ARIA support to their widgets.  Many GWT widgets come with ARIA support by default.</li>
        <li>Improved exception stack traces in hosted mode when JSNI stack frames are present.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fixed Issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed the relationship between the coordinates returned by <code>Element.getAbsoluteLeft/Top()</code> and <code>Event.getClientX/Y()</code>.  <code>Document.getBodyOffsetLeft/Top()</code> can be used to account for the difference between these two coordinate systems.</li>

      <h2>Release Notes for 1.5.1 (RC2)</h2>
      <h3>Support for Standards Mode</h3>
      <p>
      GWT 1.5 adds significantly more support for standards mode applications, but some widgets (especially those with table based layouts) may not behave as expected.  The low level standards mode bugs (such as with <code>getAbsoluteLeft/Top()</code>) have been addressed, but some of the constructs that our widgets rely on do not work in standards mode.  For example, you cannot set the height and width of a widget relative to its parent if its parent is a table cell, and <code>StackPanel</code> takes up much more vertical space than it should in Internet Explorer.  All of our samples have been reverted back to quirks mode, and the <code>applicationCreator</code> defaults to quirks mode when creating a new GWT app.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can still use standards mode for your GWT app, but please be aware that you may notice some layout issues.  If you are switching an app from quirks mode to standards mode, your CSS styles might be applied differently, which could also affect your application.  We will continue to address standards mode support in future GWT releases.
      </p>
      <h3>Potentially breaking changes and fixes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>DOM.eventGetClientX/Y()</code> now takes into account the margin and border of the body element</li>
        <li>In hosted mode, all <code>DOM.eventGetXXX()</code> methods now assert that the requested attribute is reliable across all supported browsers.  This means that attempting to retrieve an attribute for an event that does not support that attribute will now throw an assertion error instead of returning a coerced value.  Most notably, the click event throws an assertion error if you attempt to get the mouse button that was clicked.</li>
        <li>The return value of <code>DOM.eventGetXXX()</code> methods are now coerced to 0 instead of -1 in web mode.  In hosted mode, an assertion error will be thrown if the attribute is not defined for the given event, as described in the previous bullet.</li>
        <li>Opera specific code has been upgraded to work with Opera 9.5, but may not work with older versions of Opera as we only support the most recent release.  Specifically, some widgets may not be able to receive focus.</li>
        <li>Calls to <code>History.newItem()</code> now trigger an <code>onHistoryChanged()</code> event synchronously instead of asynchronously</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>General Enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for the <code>contextmenu</code> event, which allows users to detect and override the browser's default context menu</li>
        <li>Improved performance of <code>NumberFormat</code></li>
        <li>Added support for altering the number of decimals in a currency in <code>NumberFormat</code></li>
        <li>Improved performance of Animations</li>
        <li>Improved the appearance of the default GWT style themes</li>
        <li>Improved the Showcase sample with more robust examples and more language translations</li>
        <li><code>FormPanel</code> can now wrap an existing form and still submit it to a hidden iframe</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fixed Issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>DOM.getAbsoluteLeft/Top()</code> and <code>DOM.eventGetClientX/Y()</code> no longer log an exception to the console in Firefox 3</li>
        <li>Fixed a memory leak in Internet Explorer</li>
        <li><code>DOM.getAbsoluteLeft/Top()</code> now takes into account the margin and border of the target element in Safari 3</li>
        <li>Fixed some bugs associated with history support</li>

        have been backed out.  All changes relative to 1.3.3 should now be
        backwards-compatible. (<a

        <li>The linux distribution of 1.4.10 bundled Mozilla 1.7.13 instead of version 1.7.12, which is bundled in previous
        releases.  This change caused problems on some systems, so it's been
        reverted back to Mozilla 1.7.12 again. (<a
          href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1105">#1105</a>)</li>
        <li>Numerous RPC warnings were added in 1.4.10.  One of these warnings would be issued when a class containing
        native methods was found to be serializable.  This warning now only applies to automatically serialized types;
        types with custom serializers will no longer trigger this warning. (<a

        <li>A change to RPC in 1.4.10 would cause an error to be issued if a serializable type had any subtypes that were
        not serializable.  This change caused code that worked in 1.3.3 to fail in 1.4.10.  In this release, the error has
        been downgraded to a warning. (<a
          href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1163">#1163</a>)</li>
        <li>A potentially breaking change to event bubbling in 1.4.10 has been

      <h2>Release Notes for 1.4.10 (RC)</h2>
      <p>
      This is the Release Candidate for GWT 1.4, the first GWT release developed with major participation
      from GWT open source contributors.  It's been a long time coming, but we hope it's been worth the wait.
      In addition to tons of new features, optimizations, and performance enhancements, we've fixed more than
      150 bugs.  There are some important behavioral and potentially breaking API changes; if you read nothing
      else, please read these following sections!
      </p>

      <h3>Behavioral Changes</h3>
      <p>Important changes in the behavior of existing GWT features.</p>
      <h4>Critical Changes to RPC</h4>
      In previous versions, the RPC subsystem was too lenient and failed to warn at compile time about potential (though unusual)
      edge cases that could in theory cause problems at runtime.  Beginning with version 1.4, the RPC subsystem emits additional warnings and errors to help 
      you identify error-prone constructs.  While this new behavior may seem annoying at first, rest assured that fixing your code to avoid RPC warnings will result in a smaller, faster, and more reliable app.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Bad code that happened to work before might not now</b><br/>
        Previously, if you declared one particular component type via @gwt.typeArgs at compile time, you could
        often get away with passing a different type at runtime.  For example, placing a Date in an
        ArrayList of String might work.  This type of code is less likely to work now and will likely become more
        strict in the future.  Bottom line: don't do this. Make sure collections only contain the declared item type (or subtypes thereof).
        </li>
        <li><b><a href="doc/html/java.io.Serializable.html">Serializable</a> equivalent to
        <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.IsSerializable.html">IsSerializable</a></b><br/>
        Although GWT's RPC mechanism doesn't purport to honor the semantics of Java serialization, by popular demand, Serializable and
        IsSerializable are now equivalent for the purposes of RPC.  This should improve server-side
        interoperability and remove much of the need for DTOs.
        </li>
        <li><b>Warn about missing gwt.typeArgs</b><br/>
        Every Collection or Map type should have an associated
        <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.RemoteProcedureCalls.SerializableTypes.html">gwt.typeArgs
        javadoc annotation</a>.  In the past, a missing @gwt.typeArgs would generally have no noticeable effect,
        because a bug in the RPC system would generate code for all available serializable types, even if they
        weren't used in your service interface.  Now that this bug has been fixed, you can achieve <b>significant</b>
        reduction in the size of your compiled output by fixing these warnings.
        </li>
        <li><b>Warn about serializable subclasses that violate the serialization restrictions</b><br/>
        An RPC warning is emitted for classes that are assignable to IsSerializable or Serializable but that lack a default
        constructor or contain fields which cannot be serialized. 
        It is important to resolve these warnings to avoid rare but confusing situations in which exceptions would be thrown at runtime.
        </li>
        <li><b>Warn about non-transient, final instance fields</b><br/>
        RPC has never actually serialized <code>final</code> instance fields, but now it explicitly warns about the existence of such fields unless they are also <code>transient</code>.  
        Thus, the warning can be addressed by making <code>final</code> instance fields <code>transient</code> as well, or it can be suppressed via a module property.
        </li>
        <li><b>Warn about local and non-static nested types that implement IsSerializable or Serializable</b><br/>
        RPC has never serialized these kinds of classes and will now generate a warning.
        </li>
        <li><b>Warn about native methods in serializable classes</b><br/>
        Attempting to serialize classes that contain <code>native</code> methods will cause UnsatisfiedLinkErrors if such methods are called in server-side code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Module Script Tags</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In previous versions of GWT, including external JavaScript files via a module &lt;script&gt; tag required a nested JavaScript expression &mdash; called a <i>script-ready function</i> &mdash; that would
        determine when the script had been successfully loaded.  Script load order is now handled automatically and
        these expressions are ignored.  A warning will be issued in hosted mode.  For reference, see
        <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.Modules.AutomaticResourceInjection.html">here</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Additional Hosted Mode Checks Related to JSNI</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Previously, when passing values from JavaScript into Java, hosted mode would silently coerce
        a JavaScript value of an incorrect type into the declared Java type.  Unfortunately, this would
        allow code to work in hosted mode that could fail in unexpected ways in web mode.  Hosted mode
        will now throw a HostedModeException if you try to pass an incompatible type.  See
        <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.JavaScriptNativeInterface.Marshaling.html">here</a>
        for more details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Breaking API Changes</h3>
      This release also includes API changes that may require minor tweaks to existing code.  Any such changes
      that affect you should only take a few minutes to rectify.

      <h4><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.core.client.JavaScriptObject.html">JavaScriptObject</a></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Although subclassing JavaScriptObject is not supported, some people do so anyway at their own risk :) 
        Please note that the existing (int) constructor has been removed in favor of a protected no-arg constructor.  Read the source code for
        <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.Element.html">Element</a> for an example of how JavaScriptObject must
        be subclassed now (that is, if subclassing were supported...which, of course, it isn't).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.DeferredCommand.html">DeferredCommand</a></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The add() method is deprecated in favor of addCommand() in order to support the new
        <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.IncrementalCommand.html">IncrementalCommand</a> interface.  Had we
        simply added a new method overload, existing code that passed in a null literal would have failed to compile.</li>
        <li>The new addPause() method should be used instead of add(null).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.UIObject.html">UIObject</a></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The intended use and behavior of style names has been formalized in UIObject (and therefore in all widgets). All style
        names are now classified as "primary", "secondary", and "dependent" styles, the meanings of which are detailed in the UIObject
        documentation. The relevant method signatures remain unchanged (get/setStyleName(), add/removeStyleName()), and most
        widgets should be unaffected. One potentially breaking change, however, is that an exception is thrown if an attempt is made to remove the primary style name of a widget using removeStyleName().
        See the UIObject documentation for a full explanation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>New Features</h3>
      Here are a few of the coolest new features and enhancements in GWT 1.4.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Size and Speed Optimizations</b><ul>
           <li>New <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=610">size</a>
           <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=599">improvements</a> in the GWT compiler
           produce JavaScript that is 10-20% smaller; just recompile your app with 1.4.</li>
           <li>An enhanced startup sequence reduces the size of your module's startup script by 80%. More importantly, the
           new startup sequence removes an HTTP round-trip, making startup latency about 33% faster.</li>
           <li>The above optimizations combined with <a href="#ImageBundle">ImageBundle</a>, make it possible for GWT-based applications
           to load surprisingly quickly. To see for yourself, check out startup time of the
           <a href="samples/Mail/www/com.google.gwt.sample.mail.Mail/Mail.html">Mail</a> sample.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Deployment Enhancements</b><ul>
           <li>GWT RPC is no longer tied to exclusively to servlets. New
           <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=389">modularized RPC</a> server code makes
           it easy to connect GWT RPC to your choice of Java back-ends.</li>
           <li>Adding GWT modules to an HTML page has been simplified. Instead of adding a &lt;meta name='gwt:module'&gt; and
           &lt;script src='gwt.js'&gt;, you just add a single script element for your module.</li>
           <li>Cross-site script inclusion is now supported. The compiler produces a "-xs" (meaning "cross-site") version of
           your module's startup script that can be included without being restricted by the same-origin policy. WARNING:
           including scripts from other sites that you don't fully trust is a
           <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit/web/security-for-gwt-applications">big security risk</a>.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Widget and Library Enhancements</b><ul>
           <li><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.RichTextArea.html">RichTextArea</a> allows "drop in"
           functionality for rich text editing.</li>
           <li><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.SuggestBox.html">SuggestBox</a> makes it easy to add
           auto-complete functionality.</li>
           <li>Splitters! <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.HorizontalSplitPanel.html">HorizontalSplitPanel</a>
           and <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.VerticalSplitPanel.html">VerticalSplitPanel</a> enable you to
           resize portions of the user interface.</li>
           <li><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.PushButton.html">PushButton</a> and
           <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.ToggleButton.html">ToggleButton</a> are easy-to-customize button
           widgets that can enhance the look-and-feel of your UI.</li>
           <li><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.DisclosurePanel.html">DisclosurePanel</a> is a simple,
           nice-looking panel that lets users easily hide and show portions of your application UI.</li>
           <li><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.i18n.client.DateTimeFormat.html">DateTimeFormat</a> and
           <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.i18n.client.NumberFormat.html">NumberFormat</a> make it easy to format and parse
           dates, times, and numbers for users all over the world.</li>
           <li><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.IncrementalCommand.html">IncrementalCommand</a> helps you
           implement long-running tasks in your client code without triggering "slow script" warnings.</li>
           <li>A new <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=d9s6nb7_1d723ft">benchmarking subsystem</a> integrates with
           JUnit to let you record and compare the speed of code snippets across multiple browsers and multiple parameter
           ranges. Benchmarking is a powerful way to identify bottlenecks and compare performance of alternative implementations.</li>
           <li>The oft-requested <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=21">java.io.Serializable</a> is
           now included in the JRE emulation library and is synonymous with IsSerializable for the purpose of GWT RPC.</li>
           <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=844">Mouse wheel events</a> are now available
           on a variety of widgets.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <a name="ImageBundle"></a>
        <li><b><a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.ImageBundle.html">ImageBundle</a></b><ul>
           <li>ImageBundle is the single biggest have-to-see-it-to-believe-it feature in this release. Image bundles make it trivially
           easy to combine dozens of images into a single "image strip", collapsing what would have been dozens of HTTP requests into
           one: a single, permanently-cacheable image file.</li>
           <li>Image bundles manage everything for you automatically, from computing clipping rectangles to making transparent PNGs
           work in IE6. You can even choose to get the clipped image as an Image widget or as pure HTML for inclusion in a larger HTML
           template.</li>
           <li>In addition to enabling a blazing-fast startup, image bundles help make the UI look better during startup, too. Typical
           AJAX apps exhibit "bouncy relayout" as individual images are loaded one-at-a-time. Fixing this problem has historically
           required laboriously pre-initializing the width and height of each individual image ahead of time. Image bundles do the
           same thing automatically. The dimensions of each clipped image are computed at compile time while the bundled
           image file is being created. Voila! The result is a fast, non-ugly user startup experience that requires no extra work on
           the part of the GWT developer to keep up-to-date.</li>
           <li>See the <a href="doc/html/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.UserInterface.ImageBundles.html">doc section</a> for more
           details.</li>

      <h2>Release Notes for 1.3.1 (RC)</h2>
      <p>
      This is the Release Candidate for GWT 1.3, the first completely open source version of GWT. 
      This version has no new functionality, but we did make a lot of changes to get the source code and build scripts into presentable shape to prepare for ongoing open source development.
      Although the changes were relatively harmless -- formatting, sorting, more documentation, and a new build system -- there's always a small chance of problems, so we plan to call this a Release Candidate until we've convinced ourselves it's reliable.

      <h3>Behavioral Changes</h3>
      <p>Important changes in the behavior of existing GWT features.</p>
      <h4>Module Source and Public Paths</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>In previous versions of GWT, source and public path inclusions were based on physical
        directory structure; only files physically located with the module would be included. Going
        forward, source and public path inclusions are based on logical package structure. Once a package
        has been included, any files in that package become visible no matter where they are physically
        located.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>JUnit Modules</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>GWT test modules (that is, modules intended to run GWTTestCase-derived JUnit test cases) no longer
        need to inherit the <code>com.google.gwt.junit.JUnit</code> module. Additionally, it is no longer an
        error to declare entry points within a test module (they will be ignored when running under JUnit).
        Most test cases can now simply use the existing application module, which should simplify test case
        configuration.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Breaking API Changes</h3>
      Based on user feedback, we've made a few API changes in this release that may require minor tweaks to your existing code when you upgrade.
      Any such changes that affect you should only take a few minutes to rectify.

      <h4>com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.HasWidgets</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>We've moved add(), remove(), and clear() into this interface, so that any widget that can contain other widgets will be bound to this contract.</li>
        <li>The add() method no longer returns a boolean.  If a panel either cannot add a child widget without extra arguments, or cannot accept further widgets, it will throw an exception.  This is in keeping with the fact that this is usually the result of an error in the code.</li>
        <li>Its iterator is now required to support the remove() method.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Composite</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Composites must now call initWidget() in their constructors, rather than setWidget().  This is more indicative of its actual purpose, and also serves to clear up any confusion with SimplePanel's setWidget() method.  Composite.setWidget() is now deprecated.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.SimplePanel and subclasses</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
        We have added setWidget() to SimplePanel, which has more appropriate semantics for a panel that can contain only one child.  
        The add() method is still present through the HasWidgets interface, but will fail if a widget is already present.  
        This change is most likely to affect you if you use DialogBox or PopupPanel. To fix it, simply change your call to add() to setWidget() instead. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>com.google.gwt.user.client.Cookies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Cookies.getCookie() is now static, as it should have been from the beginning.  There is no need to instantiate this class now.</li>
        <li>You can now set cookies as well!</li>
      </ul>
