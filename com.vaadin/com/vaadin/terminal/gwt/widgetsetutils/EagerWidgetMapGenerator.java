 * WidgetMap generator that builds a widgetset that packs all included widgets
 * into a single JavaScript file loaded at application initialization. Initially
 * loaded data will be relatively large, but minimal amount of server requests
 * will be done.
 * <p>
 * This is the default generator in version 6.4 and produces similar type of
 * widgetset as in previous versions of Vaadin. To activate "code splitting",
 * use the {@link WidgetMapGenerator} instead, that loads most components
 * deferred.
