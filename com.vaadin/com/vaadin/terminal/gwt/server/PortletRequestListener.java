/**
 * An {@link Application} that implements this interface gets notified of
 * request start and end by the terminal. It is quite similar to the
 * {@link HttpServletRequestListener}, but the parameters are Portlet specific.
 * If an Application is deployed as both a Servlet and a Portlet, one most
 * likely needs to implement both.
 * <p>
 * Only JSR 286 style Portlets are supported.
 * <p>
 * The interface can be used for several helper tasks including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Opening and closing database connections
 * <li>Implementing {@link ThreadLocal}
 * <li>Inter-portlet communication
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Alternatives for implementing similar features are are Servlet {@link Filter}
 * s and {@link TransactionListener}s in Vaadin.
