/**
 * <p>
 * Defines the interface to commit and discard changes to an object, supporting
 * read-through and write-through modes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <i>Read-through mode</i> means that the value read from the buffered object
 * is constantly up to date with the data source. <i>Write-through</i> mode
 * means that all changes to the object are immediately updated to the data
 * source.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since these modes are independent, their combinations may result in some
 * behaviour that may sound surprising.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, if a <code>Buffered</code> object is in read-through mode but
 * not in write-through mode, the result is an object whose value is updated
 * directly from the data source only if it's not locally modified. If the value
 * is locally modified, retrieving the value from the object would result in a
 * value that is different than the one stored in the data source, even though
 * the object is in read-through mode.
 * </p>

 * 6.4.8
